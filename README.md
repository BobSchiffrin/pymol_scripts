# pymol_scripts

This repository contains some useful Python 3 scripts for use with the PyMOL molecular graphics system:

##colour_af_plddt.py

This script colours models of proteins and protein complexes generated by AlphaFold 
according to their per residue Predicted Local Distance Difference Test scores (pLDDTs).
The colouring uses the values stored in b factor column of the model pdb file and 
colours them according to the colour scheme used in the AlphaFold/EBI protein structure
database (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/):

    Very high (pLDDT > 90)
    Confident (90 > pLDDT > 70)
    Low (70 > pLDDT > 50)
    Very low (pLDDT < 50)


To use, at the PyMOL prompt enter:

run colour_af_plddt.py
